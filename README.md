CS50XFinalProject

Final Project for CS50X - A blog web app

This is a simple blog web app.

Users are able to register for an account, login, post a "blog" and view their previous blogs.
It is also possible to search for blogs posted by other users by searching their username from the search function in the sidebar (all blogs are public by design).
There is a "Home" link to bring a logged in user back to their main page where they can post a new blog.
Users are also able to logout and clear their session.
